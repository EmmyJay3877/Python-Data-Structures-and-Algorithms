"""
Tree Traversal
-----------------
    Refers to the process of visting each node in a tree data structure,
covering all the nodes in a specific order.

The two types of Tree traversal algorithms include:
1. Breadth First Search (BFs) --- Explores a tree level by level, starting from the
                                  root and moving horizontally across the levels

2. Depth First Search (DFS) --- commonly used in Tree traversal algorithm

Big O
-------------
Tree Traversal (inorder, preorder, postorder)
TIme complexity: O(n) --- as every node needs to be visited
Space complexity: O(h) ---where 'h' is the height of the tree
