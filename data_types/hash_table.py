"""
Hash Table: this is a data structure that is used to store key 
value pairs. The hash table consists of an array of index and 
linkedlist. The linkedlist is used to store the key value pairs.
The hash function is used on a key, let's say {"John": 12345} where 
John is the key, the hash function is used on John to the the index
in which {"John": 12345} will be placed. 

Collision is whe two keys hash to the same index in the underlying array.
