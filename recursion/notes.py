"""
Recursion: Refers to the technique where a function calls itself
in order to solve a problem.

Call Stack: is a stack data structure that keeps track of the sequence
of function calls

Big O
----------
    In recursion, the time complexity depends on the numberof recursive calls
and the space complexity depends on the depth of the call stack.

Stack Overflow: Stack overflows occurs when the calls stack of a program
exceeds its available memory space.
